      "Mr. Marcus, the executive overseeing Calibra, the Facebook subsidiary working on the project, struck a conciliatory tone for a second day and said Facebook was listening to its critics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe we are owning these mistakes and working to remedy them,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans on the committee were more eager to talk about the benefits that might come from Libra, but they also expressed their concern about Facebook’s plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite frankly, I don’t care for Facebook,” said Representative Barry Loudermilk, a Republican from Georgia. “But I do appreciate anyone who challenges the status quo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Several Republicans asked if Facebook could stop people from using Libra in the way that it has closed the accounts of controversial political figures like the conservative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” Mr. Marcus said, emphasizing the basic uncertainties that still face the currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facebook has designed Libra so that it can be governed by dozens of big corporate partners, organized through a Swiss nonprofit. This is supposed to reduce Facebook’s power over the currency, but it led to questions on Wednesday about how much power American regulators would have if governance of the system was not taking place in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facebook has said that Libra would be backed by several different traditional currencies, held in bank accounts. House committee members expressed concern that this could expose consumers to the risks of currency fluctuations, and might reduce the power of the dollar. \n",

      "Article Summary:\n",
      "When Ashleigh Shanti, 29, journeyed across the country on a six-month sabbatical last year, she decided that her next step as a chef needed to fulfill a critical desire: cooking food that celebrated her heritage as a black woman from the South and rebuffed assumptions about what that food could be.\n",
      "Those are just some of the dishes featured at Benne on Eagle, in Asheville, N.C., that have helped Ms. Shanti become one of the many black chefs across the country who are considered new leaders in the food world, making their voices heard in new ways.\n",
      "These chefs have crushed the notion that the food they cook must be rooted in the American South.\n",
      "“In culinary school, I learned to cook at a very high level,” said JJ Johnson of Henry at Life Hotel restaurant in Manhattan.\n",
      "Black cooks have historically seen their foods and techniques co-opted, getting little credit for their influence on America’s culinary traditions.\n",
      "“There have always been black hands in American food,” said Jerome Grant, the chef at Sweet Home Café in the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n",
      "The Washington chef Jerome Grant said his military upbringing helped him adapt to the strict hierarchy of restaurant kitchens.\n",
      "T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times Ashleigh Shanti leads the kitchen at Benne on Eagle in Asheville, N.C. Logan R.\n",
      "Cyrus for The New York Times “It’s up to us to be transparent with our information and our techniques, and pass along to the next generation,” said Mashama Bailey, executive chef and partner at The Grey in Savannah, Ga., and the winner of this year’s James Beard award for Best Chef: Southeast.\n",
      "To read more provocative stories on race from The Times, sign up here for our weekly Race/Related newsletter.] Last year, just over 17 percent of chefs and head cooks were black, about five percentage points higher than their representation in the entire work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n",
      "And even though black chefs remain underrepresented in fine dining, they are getting new recognition.\n",
      "Before last year, black chefs had gone 14 years without winning in any of the best chef or outstanding restaurant categories of the James Beard awards — the Oscars of the restaurant industry.\n",
      "The country’s broad focus on racial equality and the political conversation around uplifting marginalized communities have also helped to increase the visibility and opportunities that black chefs are receiving, several said.\n",
      "“There’s kind of this movement that’s happening rapidly where black chefs are at the helm,” Ms. Shanti said.\n",
      "I want to be a part of that.” Yet even in this moment of awareness, many black chefs, including those who have received awards and praise, say they sometimes still feel boxed in.\n",
      "Eyes still go wide when people see them cooking Mexican, Japanese or just about anything that’s not considered soul food.\n",
      "Kiki Bokungu Louya, a co-owner of Folk, a cafe in Detroit, said that even in her own restaurant, “people just look right through me to the first white male” to find a person in authority.\n",
      "Restaurant investors and the food media remain largely white, and those two sectors have significant influence over the fate of chefs and restaurants.\n",
      "“Until there’s some sort of representation in those spaces, stories of black history, black chefs and black cuisine will just be trend pieces that mark a moment that can fade at any time,” said Clay Williams, a photographer and co-founder of Black Food Folks, an organization for black professionals in the food industry.\n",
      "Ms. Shanti, who is the chef de cuisine at Benne on Eagle but has full control over the menu, got her opportunity only after John Fleer, a renowned chef in North Carolina, asked her to run the kitchen at a restaurant he was opening in a historically black neighborhood reshaped by gentrification.\n",
      "When developers approached Mr. Fleer, who is white, and asked him to open a restaurant, he said he would only do it if the restaurant told the story of the once thriving African-American community, a vision that aligned with Ms. Shanti’s.\n",
      "“My hope would be that the next time an opportunity like this happens, in Asheville or somewhere else, that a black chef is approached directly, and that I’m not put in the position of being the woke person who just happened to get asked the right question or be presented with the right opportunity,” Mr. Fleer said.\n",
      "Ms. Shanti had a business plan for a restaurant before Mr. Fleer came along, in keeping with the independent spirit held by many of these black chefs.\n",
      "Just months after arriving at Lalito, a Cali-Latin restaurant in New York, Ms. Damon went from sous chef to head chef.\n",
      "Yet when she wanted to remake the menu, the owners seemed reluctant to embrace the food that she wanted to cook, she said.\n",
      "But every single kitchen I ever worked in coming up, I never saw a black woman.\n",
      "American food was my ‘ethnic’ food and I was fascinated with it.” “I still believe in learning the classical techniques and the proper way to cook.\n",
      "Kasimu Harris for The New York Times “The beauty of ‘Top Chef’ is that they are truly looking for a diverse cast of chefs, because that makes good television.\n",
      "Still, I learned Italian from the best and French from the best, and that gave me the confidence to cook Caribbean at a very high level.” “I wanted to go to culinary school, but I knew I was never going to have that magic fairy tale.\n",
      "I’m no longer looking for anything from anyone.” T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times “My father raised me with the idea that you always have to do better than the person next to you.\n",
      "I saw that in kitchens right away: we were the cooks, but we were never the chefs, never the operators.\n",
      "So my mom said:  “I want you to learn the trade as a career, not a job.’” “I came back to see what was going on and sold out a whole weekend of pop-up dinners.\n",
      "There are so many more ways to strive for greatness as a chef.” “My biggest problem with prejudice is the prejudice against plant-based food.\n",
      "We have a hospitality charge, because this is what it actually costs to put the food on your plate.” T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times “I grew up poor, but I never knew it because I was loved.\n",
      "Cyrus for The New York Times “There’s still an idea that you have to be hazed and work your way up in this industry.\n",
      "Kasimu Harris for The New York Times “Everywhere, the mechanics of making food are the same.\n",
      "Correction: July 17, 2019 An earlier version of this article misstated the number of years that black chefs had gone without winning in the best chef or outstanding restaurant categories of the James Beard awards.\n"
